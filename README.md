Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

An end-to-end Data Analytics project using Python for data cleaning, PostgreSQL for querying and Power BI for visualization.
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that support data-driven business decisions.

The complete workflow includes:
* Cleaning and preprocessing raw data using Python.
* Storing and querying data using PostgreSQL.
* Visualizing insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The goal is to understand customer behavior, purchasing trends, and revenue drivers.

Dataset

* Real-world structured customer shopping dataset
* Format: CSV
* Includes:

  * Customer demographics
  * Transaction details
  * Purchase dates, products, and revenue information

 Tools & Technologies

* Python – Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering
* PostgreSQL – Data storage, SQL queries, aggregations
* Power BI – Dashboard creation and data visualization
* Jupyter Notebook – Data exploration and analysis
* GitHub – Version control and project hosting

 Key Steps Performed

1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python)

* Removed duplicate records
* Handled missing values
* Standardized column formats (dates, categories, numeric fields)
* Performed feature engineering for behavioral analysis
* Exported cleaned data for database loading

2️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

* Created structured tables for customer transactions
* Executed analytical queries such as:
  * Most purchased products
  * Repeat customer frequency
  * Revenue segmentation
  * Monthly and weekly purchase trends

3️⃣ Dashboard (Power BI)

* Built an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring:
  * Sales trends over time
  * Top-selling products
  * Customer segmentation by age, location, and spending
  * Purchase frequency analysis
  * KPI cards (Total Revenue, Total Orders, Active Customers)

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard allows users to:
* Explore sales and customer trends interactively
* Filter data by time, product, and customer segments
* Quickly understand key business performance metrics

📈 Insights Derived
* Identified high-value and repeat customers
* Discovered seasonal and category-based purchasing patterns
* Analyzed behaviors that contribute to higher revenue
* Supported strategies for customer retention and targeted marketing

 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   * Run all data cleaning and preprocessing steps

3. Load cleaned data into PostgreSQL:
   * Create the database and tables
   * Import the cleaned dataset

4. Run SQL queries:
   * Execute queries from `sql_queries.sql`

5. Open Power BI:
   * Connect to the PostgreSQL database
   * Refresh data and explore the dashboard
